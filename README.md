# mpv-scripts

A collection of scripts modified for better language learning experience:

## mpvacious that exports primary and secondary (both) subtitles to ANKI
the original script had only one subtitle support which didn't work for me.

## switch-sub
It's quite a simple script that just switches the positions of two subtitltes. The upper subtitles goes down and vice versa. It could come handy when you watch movies having differnt audio languages. I wrote it to get my job done and it's my first script ever written.
