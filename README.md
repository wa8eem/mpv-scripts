# mpv-scripts

A collection of scripts modified for better language learning experience:

## mpvacious that exports primary and secondary (both) subtitles to ANKI
the original script had only one subtitle support which didn't work for me.

## switch-sub
It's quite a simple script that just switches the positions of two subtitltes. The upper subtitles goes down and vice versa. It could come handy when you watch movies having differnt audio languages. I wrote it to get my job done and it's my first script ever written.

## Paused-osd
This is quite a simple script, it forced the osd to remain visible as an indication that the video is paused. When you unpause, the osc-visibility is set to auto again!

## Openurl

Open the url of the remote file you are streaming, it extracts the url and opens it in the default browser, very handy if you want to go back where you found this URL

## Restart the MPV player

Very handy when you need to restart the player just because you made changes to the scripts or stuff!
